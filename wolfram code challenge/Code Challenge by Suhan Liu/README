Code Challenge by Suhan Liu

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wolfram Language ver. Code

I put all Wolfram Language ver. codes in the file "Code Challeng.nb". 
I also inlude some test cases in it. The pseudo code for Challenge 4
and Challenge 5 are right before the codes for those two problems,
respectively.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Java code

I include all four challenge codes in the folder. I also created some 
testcases so you can run them one by one. One thing has to be mentioned 
is that, for Challenge 3, I wrote another class called "methodCls" 
including three functions to test "gatherBy" function in "Challenge 3" 
class.
